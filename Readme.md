Project notes:

This project is an attempt to create a clone of the popular hiking website, Alltrails:
https://www.alltrails.com/

It will be a single-scrolling page with the following elements (in chronological order)(Check off):

- A navbar with dummy links similar in look to the Alltrails website ()
- A slideshow with a search bar and heading ()
- A 'Favourites' section with cards including some dummy info about various hikes. The pictures in the cards should zoom in a little bit on hover ()
- A 'Guides' Section with some transitions on the subheadings and some background pictures with animations added ()
- A 'Sign Up' section with more cards, say 10-12 ()
- Further sections as required and a footer at the end (footer can be prioritised) ()




24/01/24:
- Wanted to create a slideshow under the navbar, but it's too complicated for now
- TO DO
    - figure out how to make slideshow
    - figure out how to add a magnifying glass to search bar
    - add a small star symbol next to the ratings in the favourites section

- Had to do a lot of image resizing so that the page doesn't take too long to load. Seems fine now.
- For hero elements, a width of 1920 px seems to work well
- Cards/blog cards - 800px
- Wanted to create an effect whereby images focus/zoom in a little bit without popping out of their containers. Bit hard so shelving for now.
- Made a start on the "Guides" section, but having trouble with image sizing. Need to revisit this
